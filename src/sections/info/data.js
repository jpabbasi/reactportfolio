      question: "What do you need to start working on my project?",
      answer: "It mostly depends on the type of project. But in general, you need a fair idea of what you want, then we can take it from there."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How long will my project take to complete?",
      answer: "This depends on the complexity of the project, your availability, and your payment. Once we have this sorted out, I can estimate a completion date."

      id: 5,
      question: "Is hosting and domain registration inclusive in your pricing?",
      answer: "No! Hosting and domain is taken care of seperately. You can pay for it or take care of it on your own if you know how to."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "How much do you charge for an average website or app?",
      answer: "Once again, this depends. Every project is different and has its own singularities. But I always keep it fair for both of us."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What's your payment plan?",
      answer: "Payment is divided into 3. An initial 30% upfront payment to get me started once all the details of the projec is set, 40% once the project is approved, and 30% once the project is delivered."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "What if the project doesn't turn out good?",
      answer: "You will be a part of the process from the start. You will know how the whole project is going until the end. And I will make sure to give you the best."
